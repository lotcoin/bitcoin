What is Lotcoin?
----------------

Lotcoin is a fork from the famous digital currency - Bitcoin, which is an experimental
new digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world.
Just like Bitcoin, Lotcoin also uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central
authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried out collectively by the
network. But unlike Bitcoin, Lotcoin utilizes a randomized lottery like process to reward
coins to miners, and Lotcoin also provides many advance features: builtin Exchange for
Lotcoin, Bitcoin and Litecoin, 3rd party ensured digital currency exchange, fast and safe
transaction processing which often completed within a few seconds.

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Lotcoin client sofware, see http://www.lotcoin.org.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they think
their feature or bug fix is ready.

If it is a simple/trivial/non-controversial change, then one of the Lotcoin
development team members simply pulls it.

If it is a *more complicated or potentially controversial* change, then the patch
submitter will be asked to start a discussion (if they haven't already) on the
[mailing list](http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=lotcoin-development).

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions (see `doc/coding.txt`) or are
controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/lotcoin/lotcoin/tags) are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Lotcoin.

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test. Please be patient and help out, and
remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `src/test/`. To compile and run them:

    cd src; make -f makefile.unix test

Unit tests for the GUI code are in `src/qt/test/`. To compile and run them:

    qmake LOTCOIN_QT_TEST=1 -o Makefile.test lotcoin-qt.pro
    make -f Makefile.test
    ./lotcoin-qt_test

Every pull request is built for both Windows and Linux on a dedicated server,
and unit and sanity tests are automatically run. The binaries produced may be
used for manual QA testing â€” a link to them will appear in a comment on the
pull request posted by [LotcoinPullTester](https://github.com/LotcoinPullTester).
See https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts for the build/test scripts.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Large changes should have a test plan, and should be tested by somebody other
than the developer who wrote the code.

See https://github.com/lotcoin/QA/ for how to create a test plan.
